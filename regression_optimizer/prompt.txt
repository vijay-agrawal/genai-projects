create a regression tests optimizer demo: 
1) The input is historic data in JSON of 50 releases, for each release, it contains: 
a) modules affected in the release 
b) list of all modules for which regression was run 
c) list of modules for which tests failed 

2) Use LLM to take the above inputs and create a dependency graph and store it in neo4j knowledge graph 
3) When a new release is being released and in the streamlit UI, user provides the modules affected in this release, it should list the modules for which regressions need to be run 
4) Also in the left pane in the UI show list of all modules as well 
5) demonstrate that the tool is able to identify only the subset of modules for which regressions needs to be run, depending on the dependency graph built in step 1
Make sure the synthetic data is prepared in such a way that for changes in 2 or 3 modules, only 3-4 additional modules are detected as dependent modules Make the modules close to telco usecase such as orders, billing etc
